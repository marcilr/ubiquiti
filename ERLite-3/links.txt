"The initial EdgeRouter Lite model had a plastic case.  When we developed the
EdgeRouter PoE-5 we went with a metal case and decided to also switch the
ER-Lite to the metal case to re-use the tooling.  The recently announced
EdgeRouter Pro-8 will also have a metal case."

PPTP?
If you care about security, please don't.
PPTP was demonstrated as broken by design by Moxie Marlinspike about a month ago. 
PPTP = VERY BAD.

Setting up the Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Lite and first impressions
by Jason Hamilton on January 8, 2014 in Hardware and Gadgets, Network, Reviews
Has firmware update section:
The first thing I did when I was connected to the EdgeOS was to download the
latest firmware from Ubiquiti for the EdgeRouter Lite.  When you click the
"System" tab near the bottom, a screen comes up and allows you to upload the
new firmware.  After it finishes uploading, verifying, and rebooting, the
system will come back up with the latest version (version 1.3.0 at the time of
writing).

You're not the 1st to kid me about that
"He keeps saying he is not but when you go to Ubiquiti's office in SJ he is
always walking around in this outfit and NEVER lifts his visor.  It is a
little dis-concerning!"
