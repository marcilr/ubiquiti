Simple and Basic Config to get Vyatta working
Posted on 24/09/2012 by Phillip Cooper


Recently i have been looking at loads of opensource routers, Such as M0n0wall,
Smoothwall, PFsense, etc. Then i came acros Vyatta (http://www.vyatta.org)

Vyatta comes in two flavours, subscription and Core.  The subscription version
has loads more features like a GUI, however the Opensource version Core, just
has a CLI with pretty much the same feature set.

Vyatta has some excellent features that rival that of Cisco and many other
router manufactures, purely due to its flexible deployment options, because
its software you can deploy it in a XenServer environment to protect your host
machines.

In this post i will cover how to get Vyatta up and working assuming you have
downloaded and installed the software to decent hardware.

First of all we are going to configure the interfaces.

log in to vyatta with username vyatta and password vyatta, then type in
configure.

set service ssh
set interfaces ethernet eth0 address dhcp
set interfaces ethernet eth0 description "Internet-Connection"
set interfaces ethernet eth1 address 192.168.1.1/24
set interfaces ethernet eth1 description "LAN-Connection"
set service dhcp-server
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN-01
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN-01 subnet 192.168.1.0/24
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN-01 subnet 192.168.1.0/24 \
start 192.168.1.10
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN-01 subnet 192.168.1.0/24 \
start 192.168.1.10 end 192.168.1.20
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN-01 subnet 192.168.1.0/24 \
default-router 192.168.1.1
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN-01 subnet 192.168.1.0/24 \
domain-name test.local
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN-01 subnet 192.168.1.0/24 \
dns-server 192.168.1.1
commit
save

The Above commands, when entered, will configure the system with WAN getting
an IP address Via dhcp, and LAN giving out a dhcp range of
192.168.1.10/24-192.168.1.20/24.  It will also set the client machine to use
its self as the default router and DNS server.  It will also set the local
domain name to test.local

If you connect a computer to the LAN interface, you should be able to get and
address but not access the internet.  The next section will enable some NAT
rules to enable us to access the internet.

set nat source rule 1
set nat source rule 1 translation address masuerade
set nat source rule 1 outbound-interface eth0
set nat source rule 1 protocol all
set nat source rule 1 source address 192.168.1.0/24
set nat source rule 1 destination address 0.0.0.0/0
commit
save

The Next section will set up the LAN Interface to listen for DNS requests and
forward them to your DNS provider, in this case googles dns servers 8.8.8.8.

set service dns forwarding listen-on eth1
set service dns forwarding name-server 8.8.8.8
commit
save

The next section we will set up the routers hostname, domain name, and time
zone.

set system host-name router
set system domain-name test.local
set system time-zone europe/London
commit
save

To verify this connect a computer to the LAN port and see if you can access
the internet.

Also to verify configuration type in show, and it should present you with
something like the below:-

vyatta@Int-GW-01# show

ethernet eth0 {
