Vyatta Introduction 
Last update: 14-03-2008
The interesting idea with Vyatta comes from their packaged software including XORP
and a Debian-derived Linux distribution.  You can use Vyatta as a LiveCD and save the
config on a floppy disk or install it on your hard drive for better performances.
Vyatta is extremely easy to get started because the "routing engine" and the OS are
now merged in a unique package.
