EdgeRouter Lite (ERL)
3-Port Router

The EdgeRouter Lite delivers 1 million packets per second routing performance
in a compact and affordable unit.

Model: ERLIte-3



At GCI Network Services, OSS Whit Reeve offered to sell me his new EdgeRouter
Lite for $90.  Granted this is only $7 cheaper than Amazon.  He put me onto it
and it seems reasonable.

=============================
Hit the atm at Carrs today on the way into GCI.  Took out $100 and burned $10
on coffee (bikini babes) to get $90 for the EdgeRouter Lite.  Went to downtown
DMV with Shena to get registration that expired yesterday, next hit Crossbar
for lunch, picked up drycleaning, and finally dropped Shena off at home.  Got
back to work around 2:30PM.  Long lunch.

Got the EdgeRouter Lite from Whit.  Not in box, came with power brick, and
console cable.  Plastic case.  Looks very nice as expected.

5* Pretty awesome product so far

Pretty awesome product so far.  If you're too lazy to figure out how to set
this firewall up, there are plenty of sites out there that have basic configs
you can download and apply (although, I would recommend having someone more
experienced either review the configs, or simply configure it for you).

5* Best Router on the Market!!

You can never go wrong with Ubiquiti products whatsoever!  My brother-in-law
was the one that introduced me to this product & after looking into & finally
buying it, I have not had 1 issue with my router.  It's really strong & stable
the whole time.  I tested it several times & it still stays strong. So I
highly recommend this product to those that are looking for a router.


5* You'd be crazy to not get one.

Simply put, this is the best $100 I've spent on networking equipment ever.
This replaced an older PC running pfSense with PCI gig NICs. I immediately
noticed a 20% increase in Internet download speeds.  If you get one download
the latest firmware in advance, flash it, and then use the wizard to set up
everything else.
