x Thu Apr  2 08:53:57 AKDT 2015 - Update EdgeRouter Lite (ERL) firmware to latest?

The first thing I did when I was connected to the EdgeOS was to download the
latest firmware from Ubiquiti for the EdgeRouter Lite.  When you click the
"System" tab near the bottom, a screen comes up and allows you to upload the
 new firmware.  After it finishes uploading, verifying, and rebooting, the
system will come back up with the latest version (version 1.3.0 at the time of
writing).
