Chassis

When I got the Edgerouter lite from Whit Reeve at GCI Network Services, OSS
I was a bit disappointed that it had a plastic chassis.  Apparently they 
switched up to a metal chassis at least a year ago.

Perhaps I shoud purchase the EdgeRouter Pro-8 for $350.95 and be done with it.
NOTE: The EdgeRouter Pro-8 has fans.

The ER-8 Edgerouter 8 Port Router lacks the 2 SFP ports

I know this is a bit late, and you're a developer so perhaps you're not
involved in this area: Do you know why some edgerouter lites have metal bodies
and some have black plastic?  It seems a lot of affiliates and re-sellers
don't even know which version they have in stock and is a bit maddening to
someone like me who specifically wants the metal body. :)

  The initial EdgeRouter Lite model had a plastic case.  When we developed the
  EdgeRouter PoE-5 we went with a metal case and decided to also switch the
  ER-Lite to the metal case to re-use the tooling.  The recently announced
  EdgeRouter Pro-8 will also have a metal case.[1]
