  I was a bit disappointed that it had a plastic chassis.  Apparently they
  switched up to a metal chassis at least a year ago.

  To reset to factory defaults, disconnect the Power Adapter from the Power
  port.  Press and hold the Reset button while connecting the Power Adapter
  to the Power port. Keep holding the button until the right LED on port 2
  starts flashing and then stops after a few seconds.
