DNS - EdgeRouter_Lite_UG.pdf, p. 31


DNS

The EdgeRouter receives all LAN DNS requests and forwards them to the service
provider's DNS server.  The EdgeRouter receives responses from the DNS server
and forwards them to the LAN clients.

DNS Forwarding

Cache Size  Completed DNS requests are cached so
  response time is faster for cached entries, and there is less
  traffic traveling to the DNS server. Enter the maximum
  number of DNS queries to cache.

Interface  Select the appropriate interface that the
  EdgeRouter will listen to so it can forward DNS requests.

Add Listen Interface  You can select multiple interfaces.
  To add another interface for DNS forwarding, click Add

Listen Interface. From the new Interface drop‚Äêdown
  menu, select the appropriate interface.

Click Save to apply your changes, or click Cancel.


"Under Services section in the web configuration tool, you will find both DHCP
and DNS forwarding.  The DNS forwarding allows the router to serve as a local
DNS server and then forward out those requests to specified servers."

access the LAN using a PPTP VPN tunnel over the Internet.
